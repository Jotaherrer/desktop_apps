# Overview 

This repository contains the code that programmes the desktop application to be utilized as inventory and sales tracker in a local store in Buenos Aires.
It was built using tkinter library mostly and it includes an excel file that serves as a back-up file for the sales and products information. Eventually, I would like to connect it with a MySQL database.
